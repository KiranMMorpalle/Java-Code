✅ In interviews, you can **summarize** like this:

> *“Java started in 1991 as Oak by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, officially released in 1995 as Java. It evolved from applets and desktop apps to enterprise, Android, and cloud. Major milestones include Java 5 (Generics), Java 8 (Lambdas & Streams), Java 11 (LTS), Java 17 (modern OOP features), and Java 21 (Virtual Threads). Today in 2025, Java continues with a 6-month release cycle, staying one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages.”*
